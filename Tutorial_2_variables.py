In Python, a variable is a named storage location that holds a value. Variables are used to store and manage data in a program. Here are some key points about variables in Python:


1).Variable Assignment:
You can create a variable and assign a value to it using the assignment operator (=). 


2).Variable Naming Rules:
Variable names can consist of letters (both lowercase and uppercase), numbers, and underscores.
However, they cannot start with a number.
Python is case-sensitive, so name and Name are different variables.
Choose descriptive and meaningful names for your variables to improve code readability.


3).Variable Reassignment:
You can change the value of a variable by assigning a new value to it. For Example:-
x = 10
x = x + 5  # Now, x is 15


4). Multiple Assignment:
You can assign multiple variables in a single line. For Example:-
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
